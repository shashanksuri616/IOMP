However, I can provide a summary of HyPE based on the given context.\n\nHyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings) is a framework proposed to address the challenge of bridging the style gap between user queries and relevant information in document text in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems [C2]. It shifts the generation of hypothetical content from query time to the indexing phase, precomputing multiple hypothetical prompts for each data chunk and embedding the chunk in place of the prompt [C3]. This approach transforms retrieval into a question-question matching task, bypassing the need for runtime synthetic answer generation and avoiding additional runtime LLM calls.\n\nHyPE has been shown to improve retrieval context precision by up to 42 percentage points and claim recall by up to 45 percentage points compared to standard approaches, while remaining compatible with re-ranking, multi-vector retrieval, query decomposition, and other RAG advancements [C1]. The contributions of this paper include introducing the concept of precomputed hypothetical prompt embeddings to optimize retrieval efficiency in RAG systems, providing a comprehensive performance comparison between a Naive RAG implementation, HyDE, and HyPE, and presenting experimental results on six common datasets [C4].\n\nThe key idea behind HyPE is to precompute multiple hypothetical questions for each corpus chunk at indexing time, which are then embedded and stored. This allows query matching to effectively become a question-question retrieval problem, strengthening the alignment between queries and relevant context without introducing latency [C3].", "sources": [{"label": "[C1]", "source": "C:/Users/suris/AppData/Local/Temp/rag_upload_qz8na51c/bridge.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "preview": "on-question matching task, bypassing the need for runtime synthetic answer\ngeneration.

Instead of generating synthetic answers at inference time, HyPE precomputes multiple hypothetical questions for each corpus chunk at indexing time [C2].\n\nThese question-like prompts are embedded and stored, allowing query matching to effectively become a question-question matching task, which bypasses the need for runtime synthetic answer generation [C2].
