However, I can provide a summary of HyPE based on the given context.\n\nHyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings) is a framework proposed to address the challenge of bridging the style gap between user queries and relevant information in document text in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems [C2]. It shifts the generation of hypothetical content from query time to the indexing phase, precomputing multiple hypothetical prompts for each data chunk and embedding the chunk in place of the prompt [C3]. This approach transforms retrieval into a question-question matching task, bypassing the need for runtime synthetic answer generation and avoiding additional runtime LLM calls.\n\nHyPE has been shown to improve retrieval context precision by up to 42 percentage points and claim recall by up to 45 percentage points compared to standard approaches, while remaining compatible with re-ranking, multi-vector retrieval, query decomposition, and other RAG advancements [C1]. The contributions of this paper include introducing the concept of precomputed hypothetical prompt embeddings to optimize retrieval efficiency in RAG systems, providing a comprehensive performance comparison between a Naive RAG implementation, HyDE, and HyPE, and presenting experimental results on six common datasets [C4].\n\nThe key idea behind HyPE is to precompute multiple hypothetical questions for each corpus chunk at indexing time, which are then embedded and stored.

Naive RAG treats every generated question in the set Qi with equal importance, embedding each prompt once and contributing a single vector to the index [C1]. In contrast, HyPE precomputes multiple hypothetical questions for each corpus chunk at indexing time, embedding and storing them so that query matching effectively becomes a question-question retrieval problem [C2].\n\nThis shift in approach allows HyPE to avoid additional runtime LLM calls, making it a more scalable and efficient alternative for RAG systems. The results demonstrate that HyPE offers substantial improvements in retrieval efficiency, reducing the computational burden while achieving comparable or better retrieval accuracy and contextual relevance [C3].\n\nIn terms of performance, HyPE consistently outperforms Naive RAG across various datasets, including Single-Topic RAG, RAGBench, and Ragas-WikiQA, with improvements in precision and recall of up to 40 percentage points [C3].

Additionally, HyPE shows marginally better performance on 'Noise sensitivity in irrelevant contexts' and 'Noise sensitivity in relevant contexts' [C5].\n\nOverall, the key differences between Naive RAG and HyPE lie in their approach to retrieval efficiency, scalability, and performance, with HyPE offering a more efficient and effective solution for RAG systems.", "sources": [{"label": "[C1]", "source": "C:/Users/suris/AppData/Local/Temp/rag_upload_jsm6h3d9/bridge.pdf", "chunk_id": 16, "preview": "estion\n8: E←E∪/braceleftbig\n(v,c)/bracerightbig\n9: end for\n10: end for\n11:end for\n12:return E\nThe retrieval process at runtime follows a standard\napproximate ne"}, {"label": "[C2]", "source": "C:/Users/suris/AppData/Local/Temp/rag_upload_jsm6h3d9/bridge.pdf", "chunk_id": 6, "preview": "E precomputes multiple hypothetical questions for\neach corpus chunk at indexing time.

They determine which parts of a class can be accessed from outside the class. There are four types of access specifiers in Java: public, private, protected, and default (also known as package-private).\n\n*   **Public Access**: A public member can be accessed from any class, anywhere in the program. It is declared using the keyword \"public\". [C4]\n*   **Private Access**: A private member can only be accessed within the same class. It is declared using the keyword \"private\". [C4]\n*   **Protected Access**: A protected member can be accessed within the same class and by any subclass of that class. It is declared using the keyword \"protected\". [C4]\n*   **Default (Package-Private) Access**: A default member can be accessed within the same class and by any class in the same package. It is declared without any access modifier. [C4]\n\nAccess specifiers are used to encapsulate data and methods, making it easier to modify and extend the code without affecting other parts of the program. They also help to prevent data corruption and improve code organization.\n\nIn Chapter 4, \"Methods and Encapsulation\", the book explains how to apply access modifiers, including public, private, and protected access.

Use the return value of the method, if applicable.\n\nHere are five simple Java programs that demonstrate the use of methods:\n\n**Program 1: Greeting Method**\n\n```java\npublic class Greeting {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(greet(\"John\"));\n    }\n\n    public static String greet(String name) {\n        return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Program 2: Calculator Method**\n\n```java\npublic class Calculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(add(2, 3));\n    }\n\n    public static int add(int a, int b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Program 3: String Method**\n\n```java\npublic class StringMethod {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(reverse(\"Hello\"));\n    }\n\n    public static String reverse(String str) {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(str);\n        return sb.reverse().toString();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Program 4: Array Method**\n\n```java\npublic class ArrayMethod {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        System.out.println(sum(numbers));\n    }\n\n    public static int sum(int[] array) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (int num : array) {\n            sum += num;\n        }\n        return sum;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Progra...", "sources": [{"label": "[C1]", "source": "C:/Users/suris/AppData/Local/Temp/rag_upload_oh5btilz/[JAVA][OCA Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I Study Guide Exam 1Z0-808].pdf", "chunk_id": 189, "preview": "e?
